# Task 2 - Basic Keylogger (Arch Technology Cybersecurity)

## Overview
This project simulates a basic keylogger in a controlled environment to understand how keystroke logging works.

It captures:
- User keystrokes
- Special keys (Enter, Shift, etc.)
- Timestamp of each key press

Logs are stored locally in `keylog.txt`.

## Tools Used
- Python 3
- pynput

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python keylogger.py
   ```

3. Type on your keyboard to generate logs.

4. Press `ESC` to stop the program.

## Important Note
